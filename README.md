# Belly Button Biodiversity

An interactive visualization for data of bacteria species samples

## Overview

The project involves using Plotly.js to create an interactive data visualization using javascript for the web. The dataset consists of hundreds of bacteria samples taken from the belly button's of study participants. Study data will displayed by a series of charts on an interactive dashboard hosted on GitHub Pages. This will allow for convenient analysis of the .json dataset without having to run a local server. 

### Purpose

Many bacterial species are not well studied and many more remain unknown to science. Microbiological researchers hope to discover and document these bacteria. Bacterial species that have the ability to synthesize proteins that taste like beef are of particular interest to companies that produce meat substitutes in order to improve their recipes.

## Resources

Data source: ![samples.json](https://github.com/jkenning/Belly_Button_Biodiversity/blob/main/samples.json)

Tools and Software: Visual Studio Code 1.54.3, Git Bash, GitHub Pages, JavaScript, Plotly, HTML, Bootstrap.

## Results

Figure. 1 - A bar chart was added to the dashboard for the top 10 bacterial cultures found in a sample, which is updated by a dropdown menu when a new individual sample is selected.

Figure. 2 - A bubble chart was included in the dashboard with bubble sized defined by sample numbers and color by participant ID (OTU).

Figure. 3 - Lastly, a gauge chart was add to the dashboard to display the frequency with which participants wash their belly button per week. 

Several customizations were made to the dashboard:

* Background colors of the charts were changes

* Font sizes, type, and colors were changed

* Additional information paragraph about the project was added

* The layout of the page was changed to place the bubble chart at the top
